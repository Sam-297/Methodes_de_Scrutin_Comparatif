# Comparative_Voting_Methods

This project involves the implementation of various voting methods in OCaml, focusing particularly on the plurality voting system and the majority judgment method. 
The goal is to compare these methods and analyze their respective advantages and disadvantages.

##Plurality Voting

In this section, we deal with the plurality voting system, specifically the single-winner plurality voting method, by implementing various functions to calculate candidate scores, tally votes, and determine the winner.

##Majority Judgment

This part of the project explores the majority judgment as an alternative to plurality voting. We implement the different steps of the majority judgment process, including ballot counting and determining the winner.

##Code Structure

The code is divided into several sections corresponding to different questions posed in the project's assignment. Each section contains type definitions, required functions, and usage examples.
